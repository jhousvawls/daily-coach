# Supabase Connection Fix - August 13, 2025

## üö® Issue Summary

The Daily Focus Coach app was experiencing connection errors when trying to sign up or use cloud sync features. The error `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` for `xzbkkledybntzvpfcgeb.supabase.co` indicates the Supabase project is not accessible.

## ‚ö° Quick Fix Applied

I've temporarily disabled cloud sync and authentication to get the app working immediately:

### Changes Made:

1. **Disabled Cloud Storage in `src/services/storage.ts`**:
   - Commented out cloud storage calls for daily quotes
   - App now uses localStorage only for all data

2. **Simplified Header in `src/components/Header.tsx`**:
   - Removed Sign In button temporarily
   - Only shows Settings button
   - No authentication required to use the app

### Current Status:
‚úÖ **App is now fully functional with localStorage**
‚úÖ **All features work (goals, tasks, quotes, achievements)**
‚úÖ **No more connection errors**
‚ùå **No cloud sync or cross-device access**
‚ùå **No user authentication**

## üîß Proper Fix Options

### Option 1: Create New Supabase Project (Recommended)

1. **Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)**
2. **Create a new project**:
   - Project name: `daily-focus-coach`
   - Database password: Choose a strong password
   - Region: Choose closest to your location

3. **Set up the database**:
   - Go to SQL Editor in Supabase dashboard
   - Copy and paste the contents of `database-setup.sql`
   - Click "Run" to create all tables

4. **Get new credentials**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí API
   - Copy the Project URL and anon key

5. **Update `.env.local`**:
   ```bash
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-new-project-ref.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-new-anon-key
   ```

6. **Test the connection**:
   ```bash
   node test-supabase-connection.js
   ```

### Option 2: Check Existing Project Status

1. **Log into Supabase dashboard**
2. **Check if project `xzbkkledybntzvpfcgeb` exists**:
   - It may be paused (free tier projects pause after inactivity)
   - It may have been deleted
   - Check billing/usage limits

3. **If project exists but paused**:
   - Click "Resume" or "Unpause"
   - Wait a few minutes for it to become active

### Option 3: Continue Without Cloud Sync

If you don't need cross-device sync right now:
- Keep the current localStorage-only setup
- All features work perfectly
- Data stays private on your device
- Can add cloud sync later when needed

## üîÑ Re-enabling Cloud Sync (After Fixing Supabase)

Once you have a working Supabase project:

### 1. Restore Cloud Storage in `src/services/storage.ts`:

```typescript
async getDailyQuote(date: string): Promise<DailyQuote | null> {
  try {
    // Try to get from cloud storage first
    const cloudQuote = await cloudStorage.getDailyQuote(date);
    if (cloudQuote) {
      // Also save to localStorage for offline access
      this.setDailyQuote(date, cloudQuote);
      return cloudQuote;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Cloud storage not available, using localStorage:', error);
  }
  
  // Fallback to localStorage
  const quotes = this.getDailyQuotes();
  return quotes[date] || null;
},

async setDailyQuote(date: string, quote: DailyQuote): Promise<void> {
  // Always save to localStorage first for immediate access
  const quotes = this.getDailyQuotes();
  quotes[date] = quote;
  this.setDailyQuotes(quotes);
  
  try {
    // Also save to cloud storage
    await cloudStorage.saveDailyQuote(date, quote);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Failed to save quote to cloud storage:', error);
    // Continue with localStorage only
  }
},
```

### 2. Restore Authentication in `src/components/Header.tsx`:

Replace the simplified button section with the full authentication UI (see git history or backup).

### 3. Test Everything:

```bash
# Test connection
node test-supabase-connection.js

# Start app
npm run dev

# Test sign up/sign in
# Test data sync across devices
```
