## üìà Analytics Calculations

### Completion Rate Formula
```
Completion Rate = (Completed Goals / Total Assigned Goals) √ó 100
```

### Deadline Urgency Calculation
```typescript
const daysUntil = Math.ceil((deadline.getTime() - today.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));

if (daysUntil < 0) {
  // Overdue: Red alert
  status = 'overdue';
  urgency = Math.abs(daysUntil);
} else if (daysUntil <= 14) {
  // Upcoming: Orange warning
  status = 'upcoming';
  urgency = daysUntil;
} else {
  // Future: Blue indicator
  status = 'future';
}
```

### Performance Ranking Algorithm
```typescript
// Sort by completion rate (descending)
memberPerformance.sort((a, b) => b.completionRate - a.completionRate);

// Assign ranks
memberPerformance.map((member, index) => ({
  ...member,
  rank: index + 1
}));
```

### Average Completion Time
```typescript
const completionTimes = completedGoals.map(goal => {
  const created = new Date(goal.createdAt);
  const completed = new Date(goal.completedAt);
  return Math.ceil((completed.getTime() - created.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
});

const averageCompletionTime = completionTimes.reduce((sum, time) => sum + time, 0) / completionTimes.length;
```
